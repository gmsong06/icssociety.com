## Cyber Security Topics

The 2022 - 2023 members' focus will be on cyber-security. Members will be given a tutorial with an emphasis on Android and Web:

* Malware isolation ([_Android on Docker_](https://github.com/budtmo/docker-android))
* Traffic and API analysis (Wireshark, httptoolkit)
* Access control vulnerabilities ([_BOLA_](https://inonst.medium.com/a-deep-dive-on-the-most-critical-api-vulnerability-bola-1342224ec3f2), currently top [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) vulnerability)
* Tracking and reverse engineering (apktool, jadx, [etc](https://httptoolkit.com/))
* Injection and XSS
* Fraud detection and UI/UX (email / app link handlers, common mitigation strategies including DNS blocking, ad block, etc)

## Schedule

* Community Survey - Members will poll their communities for examples of applications, vulnerable APIs, or examples of malware/scams
* Literature Review
* Sandboxing containers - Utilizing docker and shell scripts, members will semi-automate data collection
* Analysis - Identification of traffic patterns and other behavior; creating applications to summarize statistics
* Community Outreach - Presentation of findings
